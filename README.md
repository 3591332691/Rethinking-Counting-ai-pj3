## Introduction

In this project, we explore a unique approach to convolutional networks and object counting. This repository contains the full implementation of our paper, [Rethinking Spatial Invariance of Convolutional Networks for Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.05253.pdf). Here, we introduce the GauNet implementation in C++ and CUDA, supplemented by a TensorFlow plugin. Dive into our innovative method of using locally connected Gaussian kernels to elevate the process of object counting in convolutional networks.

## Implementations

- **TensorFlow Version** (Current): Developed with support from Vitjan Zavrtanik (VitjanZ). This version contains references from [C^3 Framework](https://github.com/gjy3035/C-3-Framework) and [DAU-ConvNet](https://github.com/skokec/DAU-ConvNet). Please note some inconsistencies are currently being addressed.
- **PyTorch Version**: Unfortunately, due to various constraints, we are unable to provide a PyTorch version at this time.

## Quick Start

### TensorFlow Plugin

Easily replace the `tf.contrib.layers.conv2d` function using our TensorFlow plugin and Python wrappers.

**Dependencies**:
- Python2.7 or Python3.5
- TensorFlow 1.6+
- Numpy
- OpenBlas
- Optional: Scipy, Matplotlib, Python-tk for unit tests

### Installation

For a quick setup, use the pre-compiled binaries for `TensorFlow`:

```bash
# Install dependencies
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev wget

# Set up the package
export TF_VERSION=1.13.1
sudo pip install link_to_dau_conv_package
```

For Docker users, access our pre-built images on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/skokec/dau-convnet). To manually build and install, please refer to the detailed steps in the original content.

### Training & Testing

Configure your training parameters using `config.py`. For extensive details on training and testing, consult the [C^3 Framework](https://github.com/gjy3035/C-3-Framework).
